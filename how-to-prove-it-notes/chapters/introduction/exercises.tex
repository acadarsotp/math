\qs{}{
  *1. (a) Factor $2^n - 1 = 32,767$ into a product of two smaller positive integers.

  *1. (b) Find an integer $x$ such that $1 < x < 2^{32,767} - 1$ and $2^{32,767} - 1$ is divisible by $x$.
}

\sol \textbf{(a)} $n = log_2(32,767+1) = 15$, we know that if $n$ is not prime then $2^n - 1$ is not prime, so 32,767 is a composite number. 
One possible solution is $4,681 * 7 = 32,767$.

\sol \textbf{(b)} $2^{32,767} - 1$ is composite so there exist at least two $x$ that can solve the problem.
From the proof of \textit{Conjecture 2}, if $n$ is not prime then $n = a*b$.
Also $2^n - 1 = (2^b - 1) * (1 + 2^b + 2^{2b} + \ldots + 2^{(a-1)b})$.
So one possibility is $x = 2^7 - 1$.

\qs{}{
  2. Make some conjectures about the values of $n$ for which $3^n - 1$ is prime or the values of $n$ for which $3^n - 2^n$ is prime.
  (You might start by making a table similar to \textit{Figure I.1})
