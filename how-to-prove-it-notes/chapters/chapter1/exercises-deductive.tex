    9. Identify the premises and conclusions of the following deductive arguments and analyze their logical forms. 
    Do you think the reasoning valid? 
    (Although you will have only your intuition to guide you in answering this last question, in the next section we will develop some techniques for determining the validity of arguments.)

        (a) Jane and Pete won’t both win the math prize. 
        Pete will win either the math prize or the chemistry prize. 
        Jane will win the math prize.
        Therefore, Pete will win the chemistry prize.

        (b) The main course will be either beef or fish.
        The vegetable will be either peas or corn.
        We will not have both fish as a main course and corn as a vegetable. 
        Therefore, we will not have both beef as a main course and peas as a vegetable.

        (c) Either John or Bill is telling the truth.
        Either Sam or Bill is lying.
        Therefore, either John is telling the truth or Sam is lying.

        (d) Either sales will go up and the boss will be happy, or expenses will go up and the boss won’t be happy. 
        Therefore, sales and expenses will not both go up.

\sol \textbf{(a)} 
    \begin{align*}
        &\neg (J_m \land P_m)\\
        &P_m \lor P_q\\ 
              &J_m\\
              \noalign{\vspace{-8pt}}
              \cline{1-2}
              \noalign{\vspace{-4pt}}
              &\therefore P_q
    \end{align*}
  
\sol \textbf{(b)} 
    \begin{align*}
       &M_f \lor M_b\\
       &V_p \lor V_c\\ 
       &\neg (M_f \land V_c)\\
        \noalign{\vspace{-8pt}}
        \cline{1-2}
        \noalign{\vspace{-4pt}}
       &\therefore \neg (M_b \land V_p)
    \end{align*}

Seems like the right conclusion would be $M_b \land V_P$.
